      'I’m 51, a mom in a blended family with 5 kids. I have Stage 4, metastatic cancer which has spread from my neck to my lungs but has been stable for 3 years. Unbelievably, it’s been 9 months and I have faithfully been working out with Lindsey at least 5-6 days/week. I am stronger both physically and mentally. I now use, 8-15 pound weights and can finish an entire workout with minimal pauses. My cancer is still there and still stable but without Lindsey’s energy, enthusiasm, positivity, and encouragement I’d be in a much different place. Even though there are hundreds of people online, I always feel like she’s only speaking to me.',

      "After consistently doing Lindsey's workouts for almost a year, I feel stronger and more balanced in my body than I ever did from boutique studio fitness classes. Additionally, Lindsey brings encouraging energy and positivity to her classes - a much needed levity in 2020, especially in days when it was challenging to access hope, humor, and joy. It is evident that she cares deeply for her community - taking the time to respond to personal messages, host form and fundamental workshops, design challenges, and connect with her students. Lindsey has been a silver lining to the pandemic and I feel so grateful to have been able to train with and learn from her from 3,000 miles away!",

      'I’m in my 30’s and have struggled for years to maintain a consistent workout schedule with other platforms! I had surgery 2 years ago and found it really hard to get motivated to workout, until I started doing your IG Lives when Covid hit. Lindsey’s energy is infectious, how she lifts others up and shows up every day! I’ve never had the best body image of myself, but by doing her workouts I’ve become stronger and learned to not be so hard on myself. ',
